            You can plot and choose the cars based on it's applications available that is 
            Daily use and Long Drive in three different price ranges :-
            <br>â€¢ Less than Rs.10,00,000 
            <br>â€¢ Greater than Rs.10,00,000 & Less than Rs.70,00,000 
            <br>â€¢ Greater than Rs.70,00,000 
            <br><br>
            In the Play with Car section you can plot and analyse different specifications with Car Variant
            according to your need. Also each plot consist of top Cheapest and Expensive Car Variants' pages.
            <br><br>
            In the industrial perspective, this can be used to sort out and analyse Cars
            on the basis of their Mileage and Fuel Tank Capacity (or you may say, whether they are going to be used
            for Daily use or for Long Drive)
            <br><br>
            The <a href="index.html">home page</a> consist of an amazing logo with a short summary of the application, and below 
            that there is the query area where all the magic happens! Go have a look Around!
            <br><br>
            Then there is this <b><a href="playwithdata.html">"Play with Data"</a></b> Page, which lets you choose the specification yourself!
            <br>
            (Draw whatever graph you want !!)
            <br><br>
            The dataset I used is the one given on Acehacker Website, <a href="https://acehacker.com/microsoft/engage2022/cars_engage_2022.csv">HERE</a> is the link to it
            <br>
            After some cleaning data, using <a href="#">Jupyter Notebook</a> and some mannual work, it was
            ready to give us some insights!
